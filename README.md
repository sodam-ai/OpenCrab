# OpenCrab

**LocalCrab builds. OpenCrab SaaS distributes.**

OpenCrab is the public integration repository for the LocalCrab ontology
factory and the OpenCrab hosted ecosystem at [opencrab.sh](https://opencrab.sh).

This repository contains the local engine: MetaOntology OS grammar, MCP tools,
CrabHarness evidence collection, local stores, promotion lifecycle, and pack
export contracts. It does **not** contain the private implementation of the
hosted `opencrab.sh` SaaS product.

Any sample app or API code in this repository is local/demo infrastructure for
developer testing. It is not the production `opencrab.sh` SaaS code.

## What This Repo Is For

| Layer | Role | Lives here? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LocalCrab | Local ontology factory for crawling, parsing, evidence indexing, Neo4j validation, and ZIP pack export. | Yes |
| CrabHarness | Mission-first control plane for crawler planning, worker delegation, evidence validation, and promotion packages. | Yes |
| MetaOntology OS | Canonical grammar, schemas, ReBAC, identity/canonicalization, promotion lifecycle, and MCP server tools. | Yes |
| OpenCrab SaaS | Hosted ingestion, marketplace, profiles, MCP access, community, and paid/free pack circulation. | No, linked via [opencrab.sh](https://opencrab.sh) |

The intended flow:

```text
source material or crawl target
        |
        v
CrabHarness mission planning
        |
        v
evidence collection + OCR/CLIP indexing

## LocalCrab and OpenCrab SaaS

LocalCrab is quality-first. It exists to produce ontology packs with strong
evidence coverage, traceable parsing, OCR/CLIP context, graph validation, and
promotion receipts.

OpenCrab SaaS is ecosystem-first. It exists to ingest packs, make them useful
to users and agents, distribute them through marketplace/community surfaces,
and expose hosted MCP access.

Read the full relationship model:

- [LocalCrab and OpenCrab SaaS relationship](./docs/localcrab-opencrab-relationship.md)
- [LocalCrab factory workflow](./docs/localcrab-factory-workflow.md)
- [OpenCrab Pack v1 ZIP format](./docs/opencrab-pack-v1.md)

## Quick Start

### 1. Install LocalCrab

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 2. Run LocalCrab

```bash
opencrab serve
```

LocalCrab runs locally by default. It uses SQLite, JSON files, and a local
Chroma persistent store under `./opencrab_data`.

### 3. Verify the grammar and query path

```bash
opencrab status
opencrab manifest
opencrab query "system performance and error rates"
```

### 3-1. Ingest documents (Kordoc 4.x)

PDF, HWP/HWPX, DOCX, XLSX and PPTX are parsed with
[Kordoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kordoc) 4.x; Markdown and other text
files are read directly.

```bash
npm install --global kordoc@latest      # 4.x is required for HWPX, DOCX and XLSX
opencrab ingest ./reports -r            # parses documents, then indexes the text
opencrab extract ./reports -r --dry-run # LLM extraction over the same parsed text
```

`KORDOC_BIN` (or `--kordoc-bin`) selects another Kordoc command, for example
`npx kordoc`. Files Kordoc cannot parse are reported and skipped, never indexed
empty. The MCP tool `ontology_ingest` also accepts `path` to read a local file
the same way.

### 4. Add LocalCrab as an MCP server

```bash
claude mcp add opencrab -- opencrab serve
```

Or add it manually:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opencrab": {
      "command": "opencrab",
      "args": ["serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

## CrabHarness

[`crabharness/`](./crabharness/) is the mission-first control plane for
evidence collection. It plans what to crawl, delegates heavy work to plugin
workers, validates the collected bundle, and emits OpenCrab-ready promotion
packages.

Core responsibilities:

- Decide crawl target, scope, depth, volume, rate limits, and success criteria.
- Store every collected page, document, file, image, and log as evidence.
- Preserve hashes, source URLs or paths, crawl timestamps, parser status, and
  missing-context candidates.
- Promote only after completeness, semantic relevance, and autoresearch gates
  pass.

See the [CrabHarness README](./crabharness/README.md).

## MetaOntology OS

LocalCrab keeps the existing MetaOntology OS grammar and MCP surface as the
canonical ontology contract.

### 9 Spaces

| Space | Role |
| --- | --- |
| subject | Actors with identity, agency, roles, and permissions. |
| resource | Documents, datasets, tools, APIs, files, and projects. |
| evidence | Raw observations, logs, text units, parser/OCR outputs, and empirical records. |
| concept | Entities, concepts, topics, classes, and domain abstractions. |
| claim | Derived assertions grounded by evidence. |
| community | Clusters and summaries of related concepts or actors. |
| outcome | KPIs, risks, impacts, and measurable results. |
| lever | Tunable controls that affect outcomes or concepts. |
| policy | Access, sensitivity, approval, and governance rules. |

### Core MCP Tools

- `ontology_manifest`: return the full grammar.
- `ontology_add_node`: add or update a grammar-validated node.
- `ontology_add_edge`: add a grammar-validated edge.
- `ontology_query`: hybrid vector + BM25 + graph query.
- `ontology_impact`: I1-I7 impact analysis.
- `ontology_rebac_check`: relationship-based access check.
- `ontology_ingest`: ingest text into the local ontology stores.
- `harness_promotion_apply`: apply a CrabHarness promotion package.

## OpenCrab Pack v1

LocalCrab exports ontology deliveries as an OpenCrab Pack v1 ZIP. The pack is
designed to be recognized by OpenCrab SaaS while remaining reproducible in a
local Neo4j environment.

Required high-level layout:

```text
manifest.json
graph/nodes.jsonl
graph/edges.jsonl
evidence/index.jsonl
quality/report.json
neo4j/import.cypher
neo4j/opencrab_ingest.jsonl
neo4j/export_status.json
README.md
sample_queries.json
community_reports.json
```

The packaging pipeline is:

```text
validate -> Neo4j import/check -> Neo4j graph export -> normalized SaaS export -> ZIP package
```

See [OpenCrab Pack v1 ZIP format](./docs/opencrab-pack-v1.md).

## Development

```bash
make dev-install
make seed
make test
make status
```

Run integration tests:

```bash
OPENCRAB_INTEGRATION=1 pytest tests/ -v
```
